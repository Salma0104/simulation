    "Introduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "The Van der Pol oscillator is a two-dimensional, nonlinear, self-exciting dynamical system that exhibits a wide range of behaviors, including periodic and chaotic oscillations. It was introduced by the Dutch electrical engineer and physicist Balthasar van der Pol in 1920 while studying the behavior of vacuum tubes in electrical circuits (Van der Pol, 1920). Since then, the Van der Pol oscillator has been widely used as a model in various fields, such as physics, biology, engineering, and even economics.\n",

    "Literature Review:\n",
    "\n",
    "The mathematical description of the Van der Pol oscillator is given by a second-order ordinary differential equation (ODE):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\dfrac{\\mathrm{d^2} x}{\\mathrm{d} t^2} - \\mu(1-x^2)\\dfrac{\\mathrm{d} x}{\\mathrm{d} t} + x = 0 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $x$ represents the state of the system, $t$ is time, and $\\mu$ is a positive parameter that controls the nonlinearity and damping of the system (Ahmed, 2007).\n",
    "\n",
    "The behavior of the Van der Pol oscillator has been extensively studied in the literature. As the value of $\\mu$ increases, the system exhibits a transition from simple periodic oscillations to more complex, chaotic behaviors (Barbosa, 2008). The limit cycle, a closed trajectory in the phase space, is a key feature of the Van der Pol oscillator, as it represents the stable oscillatory behavior of the system (Attari, 2010).\n",
    "\n",
    "In recent years, the Van der Pol oscillator has been used as a model for various biological systems, such as neuronal firing patterns (Appelbe, 2008) and cardiac dynamics (Altmann, 2004). Moreover, it has been employed as a benchmark problem in the study of numerical methods for solving ODEs (Bellman, 1964).\n",
    "\n",
    "Behavior Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "The behavior of the Van der Pol oscillator can be better understood by rewriting the second-order ODE as a system of two first-order ODEs:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The phase plane of this system shows that the trajectories converge to a limit cycle for positive values of $\\mu$. When $\\mu = 0$, the system behaves as a simple harmonic oscillator. As $\\mu$ increases, the limit cycle grows in size, and the oscillations become more asymmetric. These changes in the limit cycle's shape are due to the nonlinear damping term, which introduces self-excitation and competition between the oscillatory and damping forces in the system (Barbosa, 2007).\n",
